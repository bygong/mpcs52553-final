Nice work!

- I would say the `Reservation` `size` should also have a presence validation.

- Make sure to use the new Ruby Hash syntax: e.g., `presence: true` instead of `:presence => true`

- Also, make sure to use upper case for your model names. e.g., `Timesegment` should be `TimeSegment`.
Everywhere else, use underscores: `has_many :time_segments`

Great job!

- Make sure to remove any commented out code you're no longer using.

- Queries such as the following should be done from your controller, and set to an instance variable:
  `<% time_segment = TimeSegment.find_by(id: reservation.time_segment_id) %>`
