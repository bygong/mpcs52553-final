# May 20 2017

1. This project has almost implemented all the functionality EXCEPT administrator part. It's rough enough but those functionality works well.

2. You have to SIGN-IN first before you can do a lot of things. I've hide many links if user not signed-in.

3. The restaurants page shows all the restaurants, click restaurant shows possible date of reservations, click on a certain date lead you to the make a reservation.

4. default users already have some reservation, if you don't want to create your own account, you can use any of them. "bygong"(password "bygong") is default admin but remember that admin functionality not added yet.

5. Routes might seems chaotic because I'm not quite familiar with rules...Please do give advice if any.
