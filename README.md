# June 6 2017

0. Since we're differentiating past and future reservation, this project take June 3rd as current date, every reservation before that would be past. I hardcode this because it makes no sense at this point to make it run dynamically.

1. This project has implemented all the functionality mentioned in the requirements with a mininum UI.

2. You have to SIGN-IN first before you can do a lot of things. I've hide many links if user not signed-in.

3. The restaurants page shows all the restaurants, click restaurant shows possible date of reservations, click on a certain date lead you to make a reservation.

4. default users already have some reservation, if you don't want to create your own account, you can use any of them. "bygong"(password "bygong") is default admin.

5. For the elective part I choosed OAuth, there is a link in signin page to login with Facebook account.
